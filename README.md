# About my first project on GitHub
As a proficient Power BI analyst, I spearheaded the creation of a comprehensive dashboard tailored to address key business analytics for a retail dataset. By leveraging the powerful capabilities of Power BI, I adeptly tackled a range of analytical questions crucial for informed decision-making. The dashboard seamlessly navigates through various insights, starting with the identification and visual representation of the top 10 product categories by total sales, empowering stakeholders to prioritize strategic initiatives. Delving deeper, I conducted a thorough Delayed Orders Analysis, accurately pinpointing the number of delayed orders in each category, thus enabling proactive measures to enhance operational efficiency. Furthermore, I crafted dynamic visuals for Monthly Comparison of Delayed and On-Time Orders, facilitating drill through analysis for a detailed examination of delivery performance over time. Payment Method Analysis and Product Rating Analysis were meticulously executed, providing intuitive visual representations of customer preferences and product satisfaction levels. State-wise Sales Analysis shed light on regional sales performance, while Seasonal Sales Patterns uncovered insightful trends and patterns, guiding seasonal marketing strategies. Finally, Revenue Analysis succinctly summarized the total revenue generated by ShopNest Store over time, emphasizing trends and highlighting areas for growth
